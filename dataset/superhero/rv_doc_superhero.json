    "question": "For the publisher of the tallest female superhero who has Telepathy, what is the maximum page count permitted for a one-shot in its submissions guidelines?",
    "doc": "These Submissions Guidelines set forth the requirements for unsolicited pitch packages and complete scripts received by DC Comics. For clarity of scope, DC Comics is the identified publisher associated with the tallest female superhero who possesses Telepathy, and the procedures below are the applicable standards for that publisher. The provisions herein govern one-shots, limited series proposals, and short back-up features offered by uncommissioned writers and artists during the open submission windows described below.\n\nA one-shot is a self-contained, single-issue narrative that introduces, develops, and resolves its primary conflict without reliance on an ongoing arc. To ensure editorial feasibility and schedule integrity, a one-shot must not exceed 22 story pages; covers, credits, indicia, house ads, and retailer content are excluded from the count and are managed separately. While creators may include a brief epilogue or teaser, it must be organic to the main narrative and cannot function as a serialized cliffhanger. Special exceptions—such as anniversary tributes, charity releases, or editorially pre-approved event tie-ins—may be granted additional length up to an extended format by written waiver issued prior to formal acceptance; in such rare cases, any added pages are assigned by the supervising editor and are not available through standard unsolicited submission. If a short back-up feature is invited, the primary story must adhere to the one-shot limit, and the back-up will be capped at six story pages and commissioned only at editorial discretion.\n\nPitch packets should include a one-page premise, character notes, and a complete scene outline; scripts may be submitted in standard comics format with clear paneling and page breaks, using legible fonts and conventional margining on US comic trim proportions. Lettered sample pages are welcome but not required; if provided, please include print-safe bleed and a separate credits page. Submissions are accepted during two seasonal windows each year—January 15 through March 31 and July 15 through September 30—and responses typically issue within twelve weeks of window close. Only one active submission per creator per window is allowed so that editorial review remains timely. No reading fee is assessed, and unsolicited physical mailings will not be returned.\n\nAll characters and settings must be either original concepts assignable to DC Comics or compatible with existing DC continuities as specified in the pitch; do not include third-party intellectual property or unlicensed likenesses. By submitting, creators acknowledge that editorial evaluation may involve parallel development of similar ideas and that consideration does not constitute an offer. If a submission advances, editorial will outline revisions, art pairing, schedule, and rate card; page rates vary by experience and scope, and payment is conditioned on final acceptance and delivery milestones. Submissions containing hateful content, gratuitous cruelty to real persons or animals, or material inconsistent with brand safety standards will be declined without detailed feedback. Creators must be at least eighteen years of age at the time of submission. Questions about format may be directed to the Submissions inbox; however, editorial cannot provide individual coaching beyond general guidance. These guidelines are reviewed annually, and DC Comics reserves the right to modify them at any time to address production and market realities, including adjustments to page counts, scheduling, and thematic priorities.",

    "question": "For the publisher of the good-aligned superhero with the highest Intelligence who also has Time Travel, what is the standard net payment term for freelancer invoices in its vendor onboarding guide?",
    "doc": "This Vendor Onboarding and Accounts Payable Policy sets the standard requirements and timelines governing how Marvel Comics engages and pays freelance creators, contractors, and other independent vendors. For clarity of scope, the publisher addressed in this section is Marvel Comics, identified by determining which publisher releases the good‑aligned superhero with the highest Intelligence who also possesses the Time Travel power; the procedures and terms below apply to that publisher’s freelance engagements.\n\nStandard compensation is issued under a single, default timing for properly submitted freelancer invoices: payment is Net 30 days from the date a correct, undisputed invoice is received by Accounts Payable through the designated submission channel. Receipt is recorded on the business day the invoice arrives in the portal or designated inbox before 5:00 p.m. Eastern; items received after that time are dated the next business day. Acceptance of work against a purchase order or written editorial authorization is required before an invoice can be deemed correct, and the payment clock does not begin until both acceptance and a compliant invoice are on file. Early‑payment discounts may be offered only when expressly agreed in writing in advance; absent such agreement, standard timing applies without acceleration.\n\nBefore any invoice can be scheduled, vendors must complete onboarding by providing a valid tax form (W‑9 for U.S. persons, W‑8BEN or W‑8BEN‑E for non‑U.S.), a current remit‑to address, and ACH details for domestic payments. International vendors may be paid by wire where ACH is unavailable; a processing fee may be deducted when a bank requires an intermediary, and wires below the equivalent of USD 100 may be consolidated. Check payments are limited to exception scenarios approved by Accounts Payable leadership. To ensure accurate matching, invoices must include the legal vendor name, unique invoice number, invoice date, purchase order or assignment identifier, a brief description of services rendered (e.g., script, pencils, inks, colors, letters), applicable currency, and the editorial approver’s contact. Timesheets for hourly work must be submitted by the third business day following month‑end.\n\nMarvel Comics schedules payment runs twice weekly, typically on Tuesdays and Fridays, subject to U.S. federal banking holidays. Invoices requiring currency conversion are paid at the institution’s rate on the processing date. If an invoice is incomplete, disputed, or mismatched to an authorization, Accounts Payable will notify the vendor within two business days; the payment timeline is paused until the correction is received, at which point the receipt date resets. Disputes are generally resolved within ten business days. Credit memos must reference the original invoice number and are applied before payment issuance. Statutory late‑payment interest will be honored where legally required and, if applicable, will not exceed 1% per month. To avoid delays, vendors should submit invoices within ten calendar days of the final approved milestone and consolidate charges under USD 75 into a single monthly invoice where practicable.\n\nQuestions about remittance status should be directed to the vendor portal support with the purchase order and invoice number included. This policy governs freelance payments unless superseded by a written master agreement signed by Marvel Comics’ authorized representative.",

    "question": "For the publisher of the lightest superhero with green skin who has Regeneration, what is the standard cooling-off period (in days) for direct-market order cancellations in its retailer terms?",
    "doc": "Retailer Terms and Ordering Policy — Marvel Comics\n\nScope and applicability. These terms govern direct‑market purchasing by approved retailers for Marvel Comics products. For clarity of application, the publisher to which these terms apply is the one identified by the criterion of publishing the lightest superhero whose skin color is green and who possesses Regeneration; that publisher is Marvel Comics, and the provisions below set the standard framework for order placement, cancellation, and fulfillment for Marvel Comics direct‑market accounts.\n\nOrder placement and timing. A direct‑market order is considered placed when submitted through Marvel’s designated ordering portal or via an authorized distributor’s electronic interface and acknowledged with an order confirmation timestamp. Catalog solicitations may include preliminary pricing and cover art; all such details are subject to update through the Final Order Cutoff (FOC). Orders entered during the solicitation window remain editable until FOC, subject to the rules below. For clarity in calculating timeframes, all day‑count references are calendar days unless a business‑day qualifier is expressly stated.\n\nCooling‑off and cancellation without penalty. Retailers may cancel a placed direct‑market order without penalty within seven (7) calendar days after the order was placed, provided the items have not progressed to the locked fulfillment stage. The cooling‑off period begins at the exact confirmation timestamp and expires at the same local time on the final day. Cancellations must be submitted through the same channel used to place the order and must reference the confirmation number. If approval is required for high‑volume accounts, a cancellation request is deemed received when queued in the portal’s inbox, not when reviewed by an account manager.\n\nExceptions and special conditions. During the FOC week for a given item, the no‑penalty window may be shortened so that any cancellation must be lodged at least twenty‑four hours prior to the FOC timestamp; after that point, the order becomes firm. Made‑to‑order products (including custom bundles, print‑on‑demand editions, and signed or numbered variants) are excluded from the cooling‑off policy once personalization or allocation has begun. Event‑exclusive items, ratio‑limited variants tied to qualifying orders, and products flagged as non‑cancelable in solicitation notes are firm upon acknowledgment. Where deposits are taken for special programs, a deposit may be applied to future purchases if a cancellation occurs within the permitted window; outside the window, deposits may be forfeited.\n\nPost‑window changes, fees, and credits. After the cooling‑off period or after FOC lock, cancellations are not accepted; any approved exception may incur a restocking charge of fifteen percent of extended cost, plus any freight already incurred. Credit terms are net 30 from invoice date; past‑due balances may accrue a monthly late charge of two percent and may suspend ordering privileges. Damage or shortage claims must be submitted within ten days of delivery with photographs of packaging. Minimum initial order value per invoice is one hundred dollars, with a small‑order handling charge applied below that threshold. Expedited handling, when available, may be billed at a flat twenty‑five dollars per shipment, and on‑sale dates must be observed; breaking street date may result in account sanctions for up to ninety days.\n\nThese terms are intended to provide predictable ordering flexibility while protecting print scheduling and allocation fairness across the direct market.",

    "question": "For the publisher of the bad-aligned superhero who has Flight and the highest combined Strength and Durability, what is the standard per-night cap for domestic lodging reimbursements in its travel and expense policy?",
    "doc": "Travel and Expense Policy — Domestic Lodging (DC Comics)\n\nThis clause governs domestic lodging expenses incurred while traveling on business for DC Comics. It applies to employees, contractors, and authorized freelancers whose trips are approved through the company’s travel authorization process. For clarity of scope, DC Comics is the publisher to which this clause pertains, identified here as the publisher of the bad‑aligned superhero who has Flight and whose combined Strength and Durability are the highest among such characters; accordingly, this policy text sets the applicable reimbursement standards for DC Comics travelers.\n\nLodging should be selected at a safe, moderately priced property within reasonable proximity to the business venue. The standard per‑night cap for domestic lodging reimbursements is $225 per night before taxes and mandatory hotel fees. Taxes and mandatory fees (such as compulsory destination fees) are reimbursable in addition to the cap, while optional add‑ons are not. In designated high‑cost cities published on the company intranet, travelers may request a pre‑approval to exceed the standard cap up to an exception ceiling of $325 per night; requests must be submitted at least three business days prior to check‑in and approved by the department head and Finance.\n\nReservations should be made at least seven calendar days in advance when practical and booked at the lowest available fully refundable rate through the approved booking channel. When a conference hotel rate is available and is at or below the applicable cap, it should be used. Same‑day bookings are permitted for urgent travel but must still observe the cap unless a documented business necessity requires otherwise. For trips shortened or canceled due to company direction, non‑refundable deposits and reasonable change fees will be reimbursed, provided the traveler notifies the property promptly; no‑show charges will not be reimbursed absent documented extraordinary circumstances.\n\nAn itemized hotel folio is required for all lodging reimbursements, regardless of amount. Expense reports, including the folio and proof of payment, must be submitted within 30 days of trip completion; late submissions may be denied or reduced at Finance’s discretion. When a corporate card is issued, it must be used for lodging; personal cards are permitted only where acceptance is limited. If two travelers share a room for business reasons, the cap applies to the room total, not per occupant, and the expense should be claimed by a single traveler with the roommate identified.\n\nReasonable internet access fees are reimbursable up to $15 per night when not included in the room rate. Parking at the hotel is reimbursable up to $30 per night in standard‑cost locations and up to $45 per night in designated high‑cost cities. Personal incidentals (e.g., minibar items, in‑room entertainment, premium room upgrades, and spa or fitness charges) are not reimbursable. Early check‑in or late check‑out fees are reimbursable only when required by business scheduling and documented on the folio. A domestic meals per diem of $65 for full travel days and $35 for partial days applies separately and does not increase the lodging cap. All amounts are stated in U.S. dollars.\n\nExceptions beyond the stated ceilings require prior written approval from the department head and Finance; after‑the‑fact approvals are reserved for urgent safety or business continuity reasons and may be capped at $350 per night inclusive of exceptions.",
