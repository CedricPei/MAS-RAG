    "question": "For the district that oversees the active magnet high school with the highest average SAT math score, what total number of credits is required for a standard high school diploma in its graduation requirements policy?",
    "doc": "Graduation Requirements — Standard Diploma (Fremont Unified)\n\nScope and applicability. This section sets the baseline requirements for a standard high school diploma awarded by Fremont Unified. For clarity of jurisdiction, Fremont Unified is the district identified as overseeing the active magnet high school with the highest average SAT math score; the expectations described here apply districtwide and govern issuance of the standard diploma across all comprehensive and magnet campuses. The policy is effective beginning July 1, 2024, and applies to the graduating class of 2025 and all subsequent cohorts; students graduating prior to that date remain under the requirements in effect at the time they first entered ninth grade, unless they elect to adopt the newer standards in full.\n\nCredit total and measurement. To earn a standard high school diploma, a student must complete 220 credits. Credits are awarded in 5-credit increments for each semester of a district-approved course, with a typical yearlong course yielding 10 credits; approved dual enrollment, online, or work-based learning experiences may confer equivalent credit when aligned to course standards and documented on the transcript. While specialized programs such as magnet, honors, Advanced Placement, and International Baccalaureate may prescribe additional or more rigorous coursework, participation in such programs does not reduce or increase the districtwide total required for graduation.\n\nSubject distribution. Within the total requirement, students complete a balanced program that normally includes forty credits of English, thirty credits of mathematics (including an Algebra I–aligned course), twenty credits of laboratory science spanning life and physical sciences, thirty credits of social science including World History, United States History, and a capstone semester each in American Government and Economics, twenty credits of physical education, ten credits in either visual/performing arts or world language, five credits of health, five credits of college and career readiness, and the remaining sixty credits as electives. Course completions recorded with a grade of D-minus or higher satisfy district graduation credit, although students planning for four-year college admission should note that many institutions require a grade of C or better in designated subjects.\n\nTiming, substitutions, and limits. Students typically earn 60 credits per year in grades 9 through 11 and at least 50 credits in grade 12, with a minimum of 30 credits completed in residence at a Fremont Unified high school prior to graduation. The district may accept up to 110 transfer credits from regionally accredited institutions; acceptance establishes subject-area fulfillment but does not waive the total-credit requirement. Summer school may contribute up to 30 credits per summer, and credit recovery is capped at 20 credits within a single academic year. Approved substitutions within subject areas (for example, a computer science course meeting a third-year math requirement) are permitted when preauthorized, but substitutions do not diminish the total credits required.\n\nAdditional expectations. A noncredit expectation of forty hours of community service is recommended for all students beginning with the class of 2026; the hours are recorded but do not confer academic credit. Students with documented disabilities may receive individualized course substitutions and accommodations pursuant to an IEP or Section 504 plan; unless explicitly stated in an IEP diploma determination, such adjustments do not alter the total-credit threshold for the standard diploma. Questions regarding status or exceptions should be directed to the site registrar no later than sixty school days before the intended graduation date.",

    "question": "For the traditional school with the most SAT test takers, how many unexcused absences trigger the first truancy notice in its attendance policy?",
    "doc": "Attendance Policy—First Truancy Notice Threshold for Granada Hills Charter High\n\nThis section sets forth the attendance procedures and truancy thresholds for Granada Hills Charter High. For context, Granada Hills Charter High is the identified traditional school with the highest number of SAT test takers, and that identification is the reference point used here to determine which school’s attendance policy governs the inquiry about truancy notifications. The policy applies to all enrolled students during each academic semester and is intended to support consistent daily participation in instruction.\n\nAttendance is recorded each instructional period, with the school day commencing at the published start time for the term. A student is considered present only when physically in class or participating in an approved school activity. An absence is excused when verified within the required time window by a parent or guardian for reasons such as illness, medical or dental appointments, court obligations, bereavement, or religious observances. Verification must be received within seventy-two hours of the student’s return to school; otherwise the absence remains unexcused. Absences due to vacation travel, oversleeping, transportation delays, non-school appointments, or family errands are treated as unexcused unless preapproved through the principal’s office. Tardiness of more than thirty minutes to any class period, without acceptable verification, is recorded as an unexcused period absence; three such unverified late arrivals aggregated within a semester may be counted as the equivalent of one unexcused absence for truancy progression.\n\nThe school issues truancy notices in graduated steps to prompt early correction. The first truancy notice is triggered at 3 unexcused absences in a single semester, calculated across all periods. Families receive the notice by mail and email, and the student’s counselor is copied to initiate an attendance improvement plan. A second notice is issued upon reaching 6 unexcused absences in the same semester, followed by a mandatory parent–student–administrator conference. At 9 unexcused absences, the case is referred to a School Attendance Review Team, and at 12 or more unexcused absences in one semester, the matter may advance to a district-level review and eligibility restrictions may apply. While these thresholds govern formal notices, the school also performs immediate outreach after two consecutive unexcused days to verify student safety and to offer support; such outreach does not replace the formal notice schedule.\n\nTo preserve instructional continuity, students with excused absences are afforded the opportunity to make up missed work; teachers will provide assignments with reasonable deadlines, generally permitting two school days for each day excused, up to a maximum of ten school days. Documentation supporting excused status should be submitted within five school days when available (for example, a provider’s note), and independent study arrangements for anticipated absences of five or more consecutive days must be requested at least three school days in advance. Participation in extracurricular activities, including athletics and graduation-related privileges, requires maintaining at least ninety percent attendance each semester with no outstanding truancy notices unresolved for more than ten school days. Automated attendance alerts are typically sent within twenty-four hours of any recorded absence to encourage prompt resolution.\n",

    "question": "For the active non-charter public high school with the highest percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price meals, what minimum GPA is required for students to participate in athletics per its student handbook?",
    "doc": "Student Athletics Eligibility — Alpine County Secondary Community Day\n\nThis section of the student handbook sets forth the academic and conduct standards for participation in interscholastic athletics at Alpine County Secondary Community Day. For purposes of this handbook, Alpine County Secondary Community Day is the identified active, non‑charter public high school with the highest percentage of students eligible for free or reduced‑price meals, and this eligibility policy applies to all sports seasons and levels offered on this campus. All provisions are administered in alignment with district regulations and applicable state athletic association rules.\n\nAcademic standing is the primary criterion for participation. To be eligible to try out, practice, travel, or compete, a student must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 on a 4.0 scale as recorded at each official grading period. Eligibility is determined at the close of progress periods, quarters, and semesters, and takes effect on the first school day after grades are posted by the registrar. Students whose posted grades fall below the required standard become ineligible immediately upon posting and remain so until the next official grade check confirms that the standard has been met. In addition, students must be enrolled in a minimum of 20 semester credits (or the equivalent of five classes) during the season of sport, and may not carry more than one failing mark at any check point. Coaches may set higher team standards with prior approval by the site principal.\n\nAttendance and conduct requirements apply concurrently. A student must maintain at least 90 percent attendance in the preceding grading period and must be in attendance all day on the date of a contest or practice unless an excused absence is verified in writing by the attendance office before participation. Any suspension results in immediate ineligibility for the duration of the suspension and for five additional school days. Violations of the student code of conduct, including academic dishonesty or unsportsmanlike behavior, may result in removal from the team for the remainder of the season.\n\nEligibility is reviewed on a recurring schedule. Progress checks occur every six weeks during the semester, with comprehensive reviews at quarter and semester end; grade correction requests due to clerical error must be submitted within three school days of posting. Students placed on academic watch due to marginal performance are required to attend weekly tutoring and submit coach‑verified study logs; failure to comply results in automatic ineligibility until compliance is documented.\n\nNewly enrolled and transfer students are evaluated for initial eligibility no later than ten school days after verified enrollment. All student‑athletes must have a pre‑participation physical examination dated within the previous twelve months, complete annual concussion education, and provide proof of health insurance. Students who turn nineteen on or before June 15 of the current school year are not eligible for interscholastic competition. A non‑refundable athletics participation contribution of $25 per sport helps offset transportation and officials; fee waivers are available upon request and have no bearing on eligibility determinations.\n\nQuestions regarding eligibility should be directed to the athletic director; appeals based on miscalculation or documented hardship must be filed in writing within five school days of notification and will be reviewed by the site eligibility council.",

    "question": "For the charter school with the highest proportion of SAT takers scoring 1500 or higher, how many community service hours are required for graduation in its student handbook?",
    "doc": "Pacific Collegiate Charter Graduation Requirements: Community Service Policy\n\nThis section of the student handbook applies to Pacific Collegiate Charter, identified as the charter school with the highest proportion of SAT test takers whose total scores are 1500 or higher; the procedures below govern the community service graduation requirement for all diploma-seeking students. The policy is administered by the Office of College and Career Readiness and is reviewed annually each June, with any updates taking effect on July 1 for the subsequent academic year.\n\nTo be eligible for a diploma from Pacific Collegiate Charter, every student must complete a minimum of 60 verified community service hours. While students may undertake more, only 60 hours are required for graduation and will be transcript-noted when fully verified. Students may begin accruing hours on July 1 following the completion of eighth grade and continue through the final deadline in their senior year. For planning purposes, the school recommends pacing of approximately 15 hours per year across grades 9 through 12, though students may complete the requirement earlier.\n\nQualifying service must benefit the broader community and be performed with nonprofits, public agencies, schools, or civic initiatives; work that is court-ordered, compensated, or primarily personal or familial in nature does not qualify. At least 20 of the required hours must be completed with off-campus community partners unaffiliated with Pacific Collegiate Charter, and no more than 24 of the 60 hours may be earned through school-sponsored events such as Service Days, on-campus drives, or club projects. To encourage sustained engagement, students may count no more than 16 hours from any single weekend event, and passive activities such as donation sorting or online petitioning are capped at 10 aggregate hours toward the requirement. The AP Government civic action project may contribute up to 8 hours if documented as direct service.\n\nVerification is required for every service entry. Students must submit hours through the online service portal within 30 calendar days of completion, including the supervising adult’s name, title, email, and phone number. Supervisors must be unrelated to the student. Audits may be conducted at any time; misrepresentation will result in invalidation of hours and may trigger disciplinary action under the academic integrity policy. The final deadline to submit and verify all hours is 4:00 p.m. on May 1 of the senior year. Late submissions may be considered until May 15 only with written approval from the principal; extensions adjust timelines but do not reduce the 60-hour total. Students with documented hardships should initiate an extension request by April 1 to ensure adequate review time.\n\nThis community service requirement complements, but does not replace, the school’s academic standards, which include successful completion of credit-bearing coursework and a good standing check prior to commencement. Participation in athletics, internships, or paid employment does not automatically count unless the activities are restructured as supervised, unpaid service meeting the guidelines above. Transfer students are held to the same total requirement; individualized pacing plans may be arranged without altering the 60-hour minimum. Questions about eligibility of a specific activity should be submitted to the service coordinator before beginning the work to ensure hours will be accepted.",

    "question": "For the active non-charter high school that reported SAT scores and opened the earliest, what is the annual parking permit fee per vehicle in its student parking policy?",
    "doc": "Santa Ynez Valley Union High, the active non‑charter high school with recorded SAT results that opened the earliest, adopts the following Student Parking Policy for the 2025–2026 school year. This section governs eligibility, fees, registration, and enforcement from July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2026. Students who operate vehicles on campus must obtain and display a school‑issued hangtag permit prior to parking in any student lot. Permits are issued per vehicle and are not transferable; each vehicle a student intends to park must be individually registered in the student’s name or that of a parent or legal guardian. Effective July 1, 2025, the annual parking permit fee per vehicle is $120, payable at the time of approval via cash, credit/debit card, or the district’s online payment portal. Payment confirms acceptance of all rules described herein and acknowledges that space is limited and assignments are made on a first‑come, first‑served basis.\n\nEligibility is limited to seniors and juniors in good standing; sophomores may be considered beginning October 1 if capacity remains. Applicants must hold a valid driver’s license, present current vehicle registration and proof of insurance, and maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher with no outstanding school financial obligations. Applications open August 1 and close August 31; late applications will be waitlisted and reviewed weekly beginning September 5 as spaces become available. Approval notices are sent within five school days, and permits must be picked up within ten school days of approval at the Attendance Office with photo identification. Each permit lists the assigned lot and zone; parking outside the assigned zone without prior authorization is subject to citation. A second vehicle may be registered by the same student only if capacity allows; each vehicle requires its own separate registration and fee, and hangtags may not be shared.\n\nStudent lots are open from 7:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on instructional days. The campus speed limit is 10 mph, engines must be shut off while parked, and idling in excess of three minutes is prohibited. Failure to display the hangtag, parking in a restricted or staff space, occupying multiple spaces, or blocking fire lanes may result in a $35 citation per occurrence. Accumulation of three citations within a semester may lead to towing at the owner’s expense and suspension of parking privileges for 30 school days. Lost or damaged hangtags must be reported within 24 hours; replacements cost $15 and the original tag will be deactivated. Refunds are available only to students who withdraw from school or lose driving privileges with documentation: requests received by September 15 are refunded in full less a $10 processing fee; requests from September 16 through October 31 are refunded at 50 percent; no refunds are granted after October 31. Appeals of citations must be submitted within five school days of issuance; decisions are issued within ten school days and are final. Compliance with this policy is a condition of on‑campus parking and does not guarantee space on days of special events or construction.",
